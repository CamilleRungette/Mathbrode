## _Work in Progress_

This website is the final project of my training with La Capsule, it was presented on the 20th of December. Part of it was done during the 2 final weeks, and i've continued to work on it since then in order to launch it in the beginning of January 2020. 
This website is an online shop for an artist that sells decorative embroidery; Mathilde. The purpose of this website was for her to be able to:
  - Diversify her sellings by offering not only the designs that she already created, but also demands for personnalised projects as well as offering classes for people who want to learn how to embroider.
  - Having a better view on her sellings and items via a back office.
  - Increase her visibility by having a professional plateform to show to potential collaborators in the world of fashion and crafts
  
### The features:
On the user side, if you're not connected you can: have access to the homepage, contact Mathilde, check her events and her worshops and see the shop. Once connected you can add items to your cart, place an order, check all of your last orders and modify your profile
On the admin side, Mathilde can: create items, events and workshops, have a global view on all orders (sent and to send), check the messages sent to her via the website and modify or delete every items of her stock.
